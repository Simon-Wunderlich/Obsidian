A relation of sets $A_1, A_2, \cdots A_n$ is a subset of $A_1 \times A_2 \times \cdots A_n$
Each element in this relation is a tuple of length $n$ in which element at position $i$ is an element of $A_i$
A relation on $n$ sets is an $n$-ary relation
Don't think in terms of edges and nodes, think in terms of database
