For graph $G$, the edges of $G^2$ (or $G \circ G$) represent all walks of length 2
The edges of $G^k$ represent all walks of length $k$

The transitive closure of graph G ($G^+$)is found using the following
$$
G^+ = \bigcup\limits_{k = 1}^{k \space \leq \space  N} G^k
$$
where $N$ is the number of vertices in graph $G$.
