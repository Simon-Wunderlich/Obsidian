# Definition
A relation $R$ on set $A$ is a partial order if it is reflexive, transitive, and anti-symmetric.

$$a\preceq b \equiv aRb$$
# Comparison
Nodes $x$ and $y$ are comparable if $x \preceq y$ or $y \preceq x$. A partial order is a total order if all nodes are comparable.
Element $x$ is a minimal element if it has no incoming edges<span style="color:red">*</span>
Element $x$ is a maximal if it has no outgoing edges<span style="color:red">*</span>

Everything vertically above an element is comparable to that element
Ignore the fact that its not transitive or reflexive :)
