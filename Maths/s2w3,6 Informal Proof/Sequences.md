# Geometric
Sequence has a common ratio $r$ such that $a_{n+1} = r \cdot a_n$
$$\begin{matrix}
1, 10, 100, 1000 \space (r=10) \\
16, 8, 4, 2, 1 \space (r=\frac{1}{2})
\end{matrix}
$$
## Closed form
$$\sum_{k=0}^{n} a\cdot r^k = \frac{a(r^{n+1}-1)}{r-1}
$$
# Arithmetic
Sequence has a common difference $d$ such that $a_{n+1} = a_n + d$
$$\begin{matrix}
0, 5, 10, 15, 20 \space (d=5) \\
100, 85, 70, 65 \space (d = -15)
\end{matrix}
$$
## Closed form
$$
\sum_{k=0}^{n}(a+kd) = a(n+1) + \frac{d(n+1)n}{2}
$$
a = 100
r = 0.11
