# Types of proof
## Proof by exhaustion
Check for every value in the domain
Only usable for small domains

## Universal generalisation
For larger domains, proof by exhaustion becomes unfeasible. Instead proves arbitrary value from the domain will always satisfy the statement

# Definitions
#### Parity
Whether a number is odd or even
#### Universal statements
True for every value
#### Existential statements
True for at least one value

#### Common keywords / phrases
**Thus** and **therefore**
A statement that follows from the previous statement or previous few statements can be started with "Thus" or "Therefore."
Other words that serve the same purpose are "it follows that," "then," "hence".

**Let**
New variable names are often introduced with the word "let". For example, "Let x
be a positive integer."

**Suppose**
The word "suppose" can also be used to introduce a new variable. For example: "Suppose that x is a positive integer." Suppose is also used to introduce a new assumption, as in: "Suppose that x is odd," assuming that x has already been introduced as an integer earlier in the proof.

**Since**
If a statement depends on a fact that appeared earlier in the proof or in the assumptions of the theorem, remind the reader of that fact before the statement. The phrase "because we know that" serves the same purpose. For example a proof could say:
- "Since ___ then ___
- Because we know that \_\_\_, then ___

**We will prove** and **We will show**
It is important in mathematical proofs to give readers an indication of where the proof is leading, by saying what will be proven in the upcoming steps of the proof. In the context of a mathematical proof, "showing" a mathematical fact means the same thing as "proving" a mathematical fact.

**By definition**
A fact that is known because of a definition, can be started with the phrase "By definition". For example: "The integer m is even. By definition, $m=2k$ for some integer  $k$

**By assumption**
A fact that is known because of an assumption, can be started with the phrase "By assumption". For example: "By assumption, $x$ is positive. Therefore $x>0$

**In other words**
Sometimes rephrasing a statement in a more specific way is useful. The phrase "in other words" is useful in this context. For example: "We must show that the average of $x$
and $y$ is positive. In other words, we must show that $\frac{x+y}{2}>0$ 

**Gives** and **Yields**
Sometimes a proof is clearer if even an algebraic step is justified. The words "gives" and "yields" say that one equation or inequality follows from another.
- Multiplying both sides of the inequality $x>y$ by $2$ gives $2x>2y$
- Substituting $m=2k$ into $m^2$ yields $(2k)^2$
