##### Conditional operation
p$\rightarrow$q
if p is true, q must be true
if p is not true / unknown, q is not necessarily false

| p   | q   | p$\rightarrow$q |
| --- | --- | --------------- |
| F   | T   | T               |
| F   | F   | T               |


##### Biconditional operation
p$\leftrightarrow$q
if p is true, q must be true
if p is false, q must be false
if p is unknown, q is unknown

##### Tautology
Compound proposition that is always true

##### Contradiction
Compound proposition that is always false

##### Logical equivalence
$\neg$p $\equiv$ $\neg$p $\rightarrow$p
Two compound conditions are *logically equivalent* if they have the same truth value in all cases
