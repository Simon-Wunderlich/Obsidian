# Connected graph
Graph with transitive closure

# Connected component
Maximal subset $S$ of a graph such that it is connected.  No node can be added to $S$ such that $S$ is still connected

# Isolated vertex
Vertex with degree of 0

# $k$-Connectivity
## $k$-vertex-connectivity
Connected graph $G$ of at least $k+1$ verticies which will remain connected after any $k-1$ nodes are removed
$G$ will only be disconnected after at least $k$ verticies have been removed

## $k$-edge-connectivity
Connected graph $G$ which will remain connected after at most $k-1$ edges are removed
$G$ will only be disconnected after at least $k$ edges have been removed
