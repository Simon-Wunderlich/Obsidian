- Why is coming up with different ideas important when designing user interfaces?
	- So you can explore different solutions to pain points, allowing you to reach a final solution which can combine multiple different approaches to effectively address the users' needs
- Why is sketching helpful to express concepts and ideas when designing user interfaces?
	- Allows for quick ideation of ideas to get across a broad concept of a design without committing time and resources into implementing it. This can avoid wasting time on implementing designs only for them to be replaced
- What role do wireframes play in user interface design?
	- Give the designer a better sense of layout and functionality of the design in order to identify potential issues or pain points
