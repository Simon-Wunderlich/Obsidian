## Part B
```sql

- Were you able to insert Steven Spielberg into dir_awards?
No
- Why do you think this is the case?
Its just a query, not the data itself

```sql
CREATE TABLE codes (

code TEXT PRIMARY KEY,

text TEXT

);

INSERT INTO codes values ('PG', 'Parental Guidance');

INSERT INTO codes values ('R','Restricted');

INSERT INTO codes values ('G', 'General');

INSERT INTO codes values ('NR', 'Not Rated');

  

  

CREATE VIEW Movie_Extended(MVNUMB, MVTITLE, YRMDE, MVTYPE, CRIT, MPAA, NOMS, AWRD, DIRDUMB) AS

SELECT MVNUMB, MVTITLE , YRMDE, MVTYPE, CRIT, text, NOMS, AWRD, DIRNUMB FROM MOVIE

JOIN codes ON codes.code = MOVIE.MPAA;
```

```sql
CREATE VIEW Movie_Extended(MVNUMB, MVTITLE, YRMDE, MVTYPE, CRIT, MPAA, NOMS, AWRD, DIRDUMB, SUCCESS) AS

SELECT MVNUMB, MVTITLE , YRMDE, MVTYPE, CRIT, text, NOMS, AWRD, DIRNUMB,

CASE

WHEN NOMS > 0 THEN CAST (AWRD AS FLOAT)/NOMS * 100

ELSE 0

END

FROM MOVIE
