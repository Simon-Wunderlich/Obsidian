1. Separate the schema from its data  
2. Enforce data integrity constraints so only valid data can be entered  
3. Data Definition Language (DDL) supports abstract data definition  
4. Concurrency control supports millions of concurrent users  
5. Transactions must meet the [[ACID]] test (Atomic, Consistent, Independent, Durable)  
6. Implement Access Control for data access  
7. Efficient indexing for 10 rows or 10 billion rows
